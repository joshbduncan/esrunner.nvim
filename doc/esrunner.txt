*esrunner.nvim* Execute scripts for Adobe apps from within Neovim.

==============================================================================

|esrunner.nvim| is a plugin for running ExtendScript scripts for Adobe
applications from within Neovim.
 

Features:
    - Can detect app specifiers (specific app, version, etc.)
    - Run either entire buffer or only selected lines
    - Helper functions for finding and validating application paths

esrunner.setup({opts})                                      *esrunner.setup()*
    Setup function to be run by user. Configures the defaults, and application
    targets .

    Usage:
    >
    require("esrunner").setup{
      defaults = {
        -- Default configuration for esrunner goes here:
        -- config_key = value,
        -- ..
      },
      apps = {
        -- Configuration for system applications goes here:
        -- application_name = {
        --   application_config_key = value,
        --   ...
        -- }
      }
    }
<
    Valid keys for {opts.defaults}

                                 *esrunner.defaults.execute_on_single_matches*
    execute_on_single_matches: ~
        Skip the `vim.ui.select` prompt on exact app version match (or when
	only a single app is available to pick).
        
	Default: false

    Required keys for {opts.apps}

    path: ~
	The file system path to your application.

	NOTE: Most often, Adobe applications are installed into either the
	base Application directory `/Application/` or your user Application
	directory `~/Applications/`.

    version: ~
	The version identifer (e.g. 24.6.4) of the app.

    Example Application Configuration:
>
    ["Adobe Illustrator 2025"] = {
      path = "/Applications/Adobe Illustrator 2025/Adobe Illustrator.app",
      version = "29.1.0",
    }

    NOTE: Multiple versions of the same app can be configured

==============================================================================
COMMANDS                                                   *esrunner.commands*

`:ESRunner run` (or just `:ESRunner`) will present a |vim.ui.select| prompt
allowing you to pick a pre-configured application to execute code from the
current buffer. If the commands is executed in |visual| mode, only the
selected code will be executed.

NOTE: If a `target name` specifier is found in the script the the available
apps to choose from will be limited to any matching the specifier. If a
`version` is also specified and a matching application version is defined in
your config, ESRunner will skip the application select prompt and immediately
execute the script in the specified app. You can disable this behavior (see
|esrunner.defaults.execute_on_single_matches|).

`:ESRunner find_apps` uses the Apple System Profiler to find any supported
application installed on your system. This cna be helpful if you are unsure of
the installation path of your application.

`:ESRunner validate_apps` ensures your |esrunner.setup| configured application
paths are correct.
